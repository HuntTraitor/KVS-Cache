This is a cache system that uses 3 different types of caches to store, extract, and manipulate data.

The 3 types of caches:
- First in First out
  -> Replaces the earliest item stored
- Least Recently Used:
  -> Replaces the item that is used the least
- Clock Replacement:
  -> Markes every item as either used multiple times or not used multiple times and replaces the first item that is not used multiple times
  -> Algorithm to update an item used when used and occasionally marks used items as not used after a period of time.

Program created to work with key value pairs, can be updated to more advanced data types if needed
